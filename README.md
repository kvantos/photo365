## Rules

This is a game, and this game like many others, have rules:

1. Each day new photo. You cant use photo from your archive or shoot proactively. You wake up at the morning, look in to calendar, plan plot and shoot during day.
2. after image is ready, you post it in Instagram, Twitter, Flickr (whatever servise do you like)
3. when you post image you set description with tags like this: #photo365_challenge #photo365 #challenge #<word of the day> <Description of picture, like why it reflects word of the day>
4. It is important that throughout the day you think about photography, about how you will photograph the expected object.
5. The picture should reflect the word in one form or another, directly or through allegory. This in itself is not so important, it is important to think about the frame and build it using all the accumulated experience.
6. Seek inspiration. Viewing documentaries about nature, museums, walking around the city or park. New impressions have a special feature to stimulate inspiration.
7. Forget the fear. Forget that you're doing something wrong, not according to "rules." Even if you have little likes or a lot of criticism in comments, it does not matter. After all, you are engaged in creativity, and creativity contrasts with the concept of "normal".
8. Drag yourself by the laces. Try not to walk in familiar ways. For instance, think 3-4 ways to get to/from work (college etc) using workarounds.
